so yoshi's parry comes out during the first 2 frames of shielding, and that's the only time he can jump out of shield
double jump armor is based on knockback
yoshi's light shield causes him to slide really far away when he gets hit
why do I play this character?!
I lost my double jump there?!
ANYWAYS
BRRRRRRRNNG POP!
LET'S GO!
I don't like chocolate
